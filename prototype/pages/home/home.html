      <h2>What is Kolibri?</h2>
        <p>Kolibri is a vanilla Javascript web UI toolkit that allows you to build Single Page Applications for the web without any dependencies at all - neither at runtime nor at build-time.</p>
        <p>Our approach is different from many other web development frameworks, as we do not rely on external libraries at any stage of the development process. This means that your project can be completely self-contained and easily maintainable, with no need for frequent updates or complicated dependency management.</p>
        <p>If you're ready to get started with Kolibri, simply copy the source code (everything under the src directory) into your own project. You become the owner of the copied code - just as if you copied it from stackoverflow.</p>
        <p>This copy includes the documentation, examples, the testing facility, and the test cases. It will likely contain more than you need for your production code but that does no harm. Kolibri is fully written as ES6 modules, which means that you can "treeshake" with any bundler to remove all unused parts from your own production bundle while still having all the best developer experience when programming.</p>
        <p>If you're a "but I just want to have Kolibri as a single file" developer, there is a production bundle that always reflects the latest version (see version). It contains the jsdoc but neither the test cases nor the examples. This might be useful for quick experiments.</p>
