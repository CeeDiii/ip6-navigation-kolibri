        <h2>Under Development</h2>
        <p>
            Kolibri and its home page are under development at
            <a href="https://github.com/webengineering-fhnw/Kolibri/">github</a>, which is
            also the place for any discussions and issues.

        <h2>Installation without dependency</h2>
        <p>Common wisdom has it that web development comes with a myriad of dependencies.
            Kolibri follows a different approach. We do not use any dependencies at all - neither
            at runtime nor at build-time. There actually is no build-time since we never need building.
        </p>
        <p>Likewise, a project that uses Kolibri should be able to follow the same
            approach and not even depend on Kolibri itself!
        </p>
        <p>We assume that you simply copy the Kolibri source code (everything under the
            src directory) into your own project. You become the owner of the copied code -
            just as if you copied it from stackoverflow.
        </p>
        <p>This copy includes the documentation, examples, the testing facility, and the test cases.
            It will likely contain more than you need for your production code but that does no harm.
            Kolibri is fully written as ES6 modules, which means that you can "treeshake" with any bundler
            to remove all unused parts from your own production bundle while still having all the best
            developer experience when programming.
        </p>
        <p>For the die-hard "but I just want to have Kolibri as a single file" developers, there is a
            <a href="https://github.com/WebEngineering-FHNW/Kolibri/blob/main/docs/production/productionBundle.js" target="_blank">production bundle</a> that always reflects the
            latest version (see <a href="https://github.com/WebEngineering-FHNW/Kolibri/blob/main/docs/src/kolibri/version.js" target="_blank">version</a>). It contains the
            jsdoc but neither the test cases nor the examples.
            This might be useful for quick experiments.

        <p>When changing default css or the style API, make sure to check examples, test report, and

        <h3 id="inspection-profile">Inspection Profile</h3>
        <p>The settings for the inspection profile are maintained in the file <code>JS_TypeSystem.xml</code>
            that can be imported in IntelliJIDEA under Preferences -&gt; Inspection Profile.</p>
        <p>The goal is to never push code that causes any inspection findings.
            Some perceived typos (unknown words) might remain that you can safely add to your local dictionary.</p>
